## Lab 1
### Shared memory

2 programs have to be created: the first program should write data to shared memory and the second one should read and print it to console.

There are two versions available:

* **no_duplicates**: when two exactly equal pieces of data have been written, only one copy should be read and printed by reader
* **duplicates**: all messages should be printed, with no matter to their equality

Those versions are located in correspondingly named folders
